slab
====

developer interface between mobile phone and pc

Built with PhoneGap, NodeJS and SocketIO

Slab is made to solve 2 problems

1. Too many controls on the pc screen. I would like it if developers made pc apps that moved a bunch of the controls to the phone screen so if i need to change them i can look down and do so, keeping my deskop screen clean and peaceful.
2. Make it easier to use a pc from the couch without having to get up.


Guid to setup dev env
1. install phonegap
	npm install -g phonegap

2. install android-sdk to deploy to android (Make sure to install SDK platform for API 19 through eclipse -> window -> sdk manager)

3. export android paths for phonegap
	export PATH=${PATH}:/home/trevor/workspace/androidLib/sdk/platform-tools:/home/trevor/workspace/androidLib/sdk/tools

4. install nodejs

5. have fun
